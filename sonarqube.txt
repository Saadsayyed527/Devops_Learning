✅ 7. Common SonarQube Interview Questions & Answers
❓ Q1: What is a code smell?
A: A code smell is a surface-level indication that there might be a deeper problem in the code. It doesn't necessarily mean a bug but may reduce maintainability.

❓ Q2: What is a Quality Gate?
A: A Quality Gate defines the pass/fail rules for code (e.g., 0 new bugs, <3% duplication). It ensures quality before deployment.

❓ Q3: How does SonarQube detect bugs?
A: SonarQube uses static code analysis through language-specific rules and plugins. These rules are applied when scanning code to detect issues.

❓ Q4: What is the difference between a bug, vulnerability, and code smell?
Type	Description
Bug	Logic error in code that can produce incorrect results
Vulnerability	Security risk in the code
Code Smell	Bad practice that may affect maintainability

❓ Q5: How to ignore files/folders from analysis?
A: In sonar-project.properties, add:

properties
Copy
Edit
sonar.exclusions=**/test/**,**/*.spec.js
✅ 8. Example sonar-project.properties File
properties
Copy
Edit
sonar.projectKey=my_project
sonar.projectName=My Project
sonar.projectVersion=1.0
sonar.sources=src
sonar.tests=tests
sonar.language=java
sonar.sourceEncoding=UTF-8
✅ 9. Profitability (Is It Worth Using?)
Point	Description
ROI	Prevents costly bugs before production
Productivity	Developers get early feedback
Maintainability	Cleaner, modular code with less tech debt
Free	Community version is open-source
Scalable	Enterprise version for large teams and deeper reports

✅ 10. Sample Java Code with a Code Smell
java
Copy
Edit
// Code with duplication and smell
public class Calculator {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    public int addAgain(int x, int y) {
        return x + y; // Duplicate logic (code smell)
    }
}
SonarQube will flag addAgain as a duplicate logic/code smell.

okay now for the intermediate level


ChatGPT said:
Great! Let’s move to Intermediate-Level SonarQube concepts and questions. These will help you stand out in an interview, especially if the interviewer wants more than just basics.

🔷 1. Key Intermediate Concepts
🔹 1.1 Custom Quality Gates
You can define your own pass/fail criteria.

Example: Block merge if new code coverage < 80% or new bugs > 0

🛠️ Go to Quality Gates → Create → Add Conditions (like bugs > 0)

🔹 1.2 Code Coverage & Unit Testing
SonarQube does not run tests, it reads coverage reports.

You need to generate them with tools like:

Java → JaCoCo

JS → Jest, nyc

Python → coverage.py

📁 Then feed to SonarQube:

properties
Copy
Edit
sonar.coverageReportPaths=build/reports/jacoco/test/jacocoTestReport.xml
🔹 1.3 Pull Request Decoration
SonarQube can comment directly on Pull Requests (PRs) in GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket.

Requires Developer Edition+

Shows inline issues before merge.

🔹 1.4 Branch Analysis
Community Edition: Only main branch

Developer Edition+: Supports multi-branch analysis and PR decoration

🔹 1.5 Rules & Profiles
SonarQube has rule sets (quality profiles) per language.

You can:

Enable/disable rules

Create custom rules

Assign different profiles to different projects

🔹 1.6 SonarLint
IDE plugin (VSCode, IntelliJ, Eclipse)

Shows issues live as you write code

Can be connected to SonarQube server for rule syncing

🔶 2. Intermediate Interview Questions (with Answers)
❓ Q1: How do you enforce that only new code is clean?
A: Using the “New Code” concept in SonarQube. It can be defined as:

Since last version

Since last 30 days

Since specific date

Then set Quality Gate on New Code only (e.g., no new bugs or ≥80% coverage).

❓ Q2: How is SonarQube different from tools like ESLint or PMD?
A: SonarQube:

Is centralized, provides historical dashboards.

Supports multiple languages, rules, and integration into pipelines.

Can handle PR feedback, coverage, and technical debt metrics.
Whereas ESLint/PMD are limited to a specific language/tool.

❓ Q3: Can we write custom rules in SonarQube?
A: Yes, for Java (and other languages in enterprise edition).

Java: Write custom rule using SonarQube Plugin API (JavaCheck)

For other languages, limited to what edition and plugin supports.

❓ Q4: Explain Technical Debt and Maintainability Rating.
A:

Technical Debt: Estimated effort to fix all issues.

Maintainability Rating: From A to E based on debt ratio:

A: ≤5%

B: ≤10%

...

E: >50%

❓ Q5: What are hotspots in SonarQube?
A:

Security Hotspots: Parts of code that require manual review for potential security issues.

Not necessarily bugs, but could be if misused.

❓ Q6: Can you integrate SonarQube with Docker?
A: Yes, easily:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Start SonarQube in Docker
docker run -d --name sonarqube \
  -p 9000:9000 \
  sonarqube:community
Then access it via http://localhost:9000

🧪 3. Intermediate Project Setup Example
Example: sonar-project.properties with test reports
properties
Copy
Edit
sonar.projectKey=my-java-app
sonar.projectName=My Java App
sonar.sources=src/main

sonar.junit.reportPaths=target/surefire-reports
sonar.coverage.jacoco.xmlReportPaths=target/site/jacoco/jacoco.xml
sonar.exclusions=**/*Test.java
sonar.java.source=17
💻 4. Integrating Coverage for Java with Maven & JaCoCo
Step-by-step:
Add plugin to pom.xml:

xml
Copy
Edit
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.jacoco</groupId>
      <artifactId>jacoco-maven-plugin</artifactId>
