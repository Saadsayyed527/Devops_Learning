‚úÖ 1. What is Terraform?
Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool by HashiCorp that allows you to define and provision infrastructure using a declarative configuration language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language).

‚úÖ 2. Core Terraform Concepts
Concept	Description
Providers	Plugin responsible for managing resources (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
Resources	The components managed by Terraform (e.g., EC2, S3, VPC).
Modules	A container for multiple resources that are used together.
State	Tracks the current state of infrastructure. Stored in terraform.tfstate.
Variables	Dynamic input values.
Outputs	Displayed information after applying configuration.
Data Sources	Read-only information fetched from provider APIs.

‚úÖ 3. Terraform Basic Template (AWS EC2 Example)
hcl
Copy
Edit
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0" # Replace with a valid AMI
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "TerraformDemo"
  }
}
Commands to Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
terraform init     # Initialize project
terraform plan     # Show execution plan
terraform apply    # Apply the configuration
terraform destroy  # Destroy all resources
‚úÖ 4. Common Terraform Interview Questions and Answers
Q1: What is Terraform used for?
Answer: Terraform is used for automating the provisioning and management of infrastructure across various cloud providers using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

Q2: What is a provider in Terraform?
Answer: A provider is a plugin that allows Terraform to interact with APIs of cloud platforms (like AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.). You configure it to define which cloud service you‚Äôre using.

Q3: What are the main commands in Terraform?
terraform init ‚Äì Initializes the working directory.

terraform plan ‚Äì Shows what changes will be made.

terraform apply ‚Äì Applies the changes.

terraform destroy ‚Äì Removes the created resources.

Q4: What is the state file in Terraform?
Answer: The terraform.tfstate file keeps track of the resources Terraform manages. It maps your configuration to real-world infrastructure.

Q5: How does Terraform handle dependencies?
Answer: Terraform builds a dependency graph based on resource references and ensures that resources are created or destroyed in the correct order.

Q6: What are Terraform modules?
Answer: Modules are reusable groups of Terraform resources. They help you organize and reuse code.

Example of calling a module:

hcl
Copy
Edit
module "vpc" {
  source = "./modules/vpc"
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}
Q7: How do you pass variables in Terraform?
1. Define:

hcl
Copy
Edit
variable "region" {
  default = "us-east-1"
}
2. Use:

hcl
Copy
Edit
provider "aws" {
  region = var.region
}
3. Pass via CLI or file:

bash
Copy
Edit
terraform apply -var="region=us-west-2"
Q8: What is terraform remote state?
Answer: Remote state allows the terraform.tfstate file to be stored in a remote backend like S3. It enables collaboration and versioning.

Q9: What are outputs used for?
Answer: Outputs are used to display information after apply, such as IP addresses, DNS names, etc.

hcl
Copy
Edit
output "instance_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.example.public_ip
}
‚úÖ 5. Sample End-to-End Project (AWS EC2 + Output + Variable)
hcl
Copy
Edit
provider "aws" {
  region = var.region
}

variable "region" {
  default = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "demo" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "DemoServer"
  }
}

output "public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.demo.public_ip
}
‚úÖ 6. Terraform Best Practices
Use modules for reuse.

Keep secrets and state secure.

Use .tfvars files for variable values.

Lock provider versions.

Use remote backend for team collaboration.

‚úÖ 7. Quick Tips for Interview
Know the difference between terraform plan vs terraform apply.

Be prepared to explain how Terraform compares to other IaC tools (like CloudFormation or Ansible).

Know how to handle errors and interpret the plan output.

Be ready to write a simple HCL script on the spot.

Learn about terraform import, taint, state rm, and lifecycle blocks.

Would you like a mock interview session or quiz to test your knowledge?

üìÑ Intermediate Code Snippets & Examples
‚úÖ 1. Using count to Deploy Multiple EC2 Instances
hcl
Copy
Edit
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  count         = 3
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "web-${count.index}"
  }
}
‚úÖ 2. Using for_each with a Map
h
Copy
Edit
variable "servers" {
  default = {
    app  = "t2.micro"
    db   = "t2.small"
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "multi" {
  for_each      = var.servers
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = each.value

  tags = {
    Name = each.key
  }
}
‚úÖ 3. Remote Backend (S3) Configuration
hcl
Copy
Edit
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-tf-state-bucket"
    key            = "env/dev/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
  }
}
‚úÖ 4. Using a data Source to Get Existing VPC
hcl
Copy
Edit
data "aws_vpc" "selected" {
  filter {
    name   = "tag:Name"
    values = ["main-vpc"]
  }
}
‚úÖ 5. Lifecycle Block
hcl
Copy
Edit
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
    prevent_destroy       = true
  }
}
‚ùì Intermediate-Level Interview Questions & Answers
Q1: What is the difference between count and for_each?
A:

count is used for creating multiple identical resources, indexed numerically.

for_each is used when working with maps or sets, giving more descriptive control via keys.

Q2: How does Terraform handle state locking?
A:
When using remote state backends (like S3 with DynamoDB), Terraform locks the state file to avoid race conditions during concurrent runs.

Q3: What is the purpose of the terraform import command?
A:
It brings existing infrastructure into Terraform's management. For example:

bash
Copy
Edit
terraform import aws_instance.example i-1234567890abcdef0
Q4: What are provisioners in Terraform and when should you use them?
A:
Provisioners execute scripts or commands on local/remote machines. Use them only as a last resort; Terraform recommends managing provisioning through configuration management tools.

hcl
Copy
Edit
provisioner "remote-exec" {
  inline = [
    "sudo apt-get update",
    "sudo apt-get install -y nginx"
  ]
}
Q5: What is a data source and how is it used?
A:
A data source allows you to fetch existing resources managed outside Terraform (or by other teams), e.g., VPCs, AMIs, etc.

Q6: How do you manage multiple environments in Terraform?
A:

Workspaces: Use terraform workspace new dev, etc.

Directory Structure: Have separate folders or modules per environment.

Variable files: Use dev.tfvars, prod.tfvars.

Q7: What is the difference between terraform taint and terraform destroy?
A:

taint: Marks a resource for recreation in the next apply.

destroy: Deletes the resource immediately.

Q8: What is the purpose of a backend in Terraform?
A:
A backend defines where Terraform stores its state file. Common backends include S3, Terraform Cloud, Consul, etc.

Q9: How do you reference the output from one module in another?
hcl
Copy
Edit
module "vpc" {
  source = "./vpc"
}

module "ec2" {
  source   = "./ec2"
  vpc_id   = module.vpc.vpc_id
}
Q10: What are some built-in Terraform functions you commonly use?
join(), split()

lookup()

length()

element()

file()

format()

Example:

hcl
Copy
Edit
output "joined_example" {
  value = join(",", ["a", "b", "c"])  # "a,b,c"
}
