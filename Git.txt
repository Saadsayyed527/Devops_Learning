âœ… GIT THEORY (For Interview)
1. What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that helps multiple developers work on the same project without interfering with each other's work. Every developer has a local copy (repository) of the entire project, and changes are merged efficiently.

2. Why Use Git?
Tracks changes in source code.

Allows collaboration.

Keeps history (rollback, revert).

Supports branching and merging.

Works offline (local repo).

3. Git vs. GitHub
Feature	Git	GitHub
Type	Tool (VCS)	Hosting service for Git repos
Works Offline	Yes	No
Access	Local	Online (cloud-based)
Usage	Tracking code changes	Sharing and collaborating

4. What is a repository?
A repository is a directory where Git stores all project files and the history of changes.

Local repo: On your system.

Remote repo: On GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.

5. What is a branch?
A branch is a copy of the codebase where you can make changes without affecting the main code (usually main or master).

Default branch: main or master

Developers often use feature, bugfix, or test branches.

6. Git Lifecycle
Working Directory â€“ Actual files you're working on.

Staging Area (Index) â€“ Files marked for commit.

Local Repository â€“ Commits saved here.

Remote Repository â€“ Shared repo (like on GitHub).

ðŸ“Œ COMMONLY ASKED GIT COMMANDS (With Explanation)
Command	Description
git init	Initializes a new Git repo in current directory
git clone <url>	Copies (clones) a remote repository to your local machine
git status	Shows current status of working directory and staging area
git add <file>	Adds file to staging area
git add .	Adds all modified and new files to staging area
git commit -m "message"	Commits staged changes with a message
git log	Shows commit history
git diff	Shows changes not yet staged or committed
git branch	Lists all branches
git branch <name>	Creates a new branch
git checkout <branch>	Switches to another branch
git merge <branch>	Merges specified branch into current branch
git pull	Fetches and merges changes from remote to local
git push	Pushes committed changes from local to remote
git remote -v	Shows the remote repo's URL
git rm <file>	Removes a file from staging and working directory
git reset <file>	Removes file from staging area (not from working directory)
git stash	Temporarily shelves changes so you can work on something else
git stash pop	Applies last stashed changes back to working directory

ðŸŽ¯ GIT INTERVIEW QUESTIONS FOR FRESHERS (With Answers)
1. What is the difference between Git and SVN?
Git is distributed, SVN is centralized.

Git is faster and can work offline.

Git supports multiple branches better than SVN.

2. What is the difference between git pull and git fetch?
git fetch downloads the latest changes but does not merge them.

git pull = git fetch + git merge â†’ downloads and merges changes.

3. How do you resolve merge conflicts in Git?
When two branches change the same part of a file, Git can't decide which to keep.

Manually edit the conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>), then:

bash
Copy code
git add <resolved_file>
git commit -m "Resolved conflict"
4. What is the HEAD in Git?
HEAD is a pointer that refers to the latest commit on the current branch.

5. What is a detached HEAD?
When you check out a commit directly (not a branch), Git enters a detached HEAD state. Youâ€™re no longer on a branch.

6. Explain Staging and Commit.
Staging (git add): Prepares files for commit.

Commit (git commit): Saves changes to the local repo.

7. What are tags in Git?
Tags are used to mark specific points in history, usually for releases.

bash
Copy code
git tag v1.0
git push origin v1.0
8. Can you delete a branch in Git?
Yes:

Local: git branch -d branch_name

Remote: git push origin --delete branch_name

9. What is .gitignore?
A file where you list filenames/directories Git should ignore (not track), like:

bash
Copy code
node_modules/
*.log
.env
10. How can you revert a commit?
git revert <commit> â€“ Creates a new commit that undoes changes.

git reset --hard <commit> â€“ Resets repo to a previous state (dangerous).
