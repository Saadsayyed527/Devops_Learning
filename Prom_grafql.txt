🔰 BASICS: What is Prometheus & Grafana?
📘 Prometheus
Definition: Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit, mainly used for metrics-based monitoring.

Key Features:

Pull-based metrics collection via HTTP (not push).

Uses its own query language: PromQL.

Stores time-series data (metrics over time).

Integrates easily with Kubernetes, Docker, etc.

Use Case: Monitor CPU, memory, service health, DB queries, etc.

📗 Grafana
Definition: Grafana is an open-source visualization tool used for creating dashboards from time-series data (like from Prometheus).

Key Features:

Real-time dashboards.

Alerts, annotations, plugins.

Supports multiple data sources (Prometheus, Loki, MySQL, etc).

Use Case: Visualize application health, infra usage, trends, etc.

📝 Access:

Prometheus UI: http://localhost:9090

Grafana UI: http://localhost:3000 (default user: admin / admin)

🛠️ Prometheus Configuration (Basic)
prometheus.yml

yaml
Copy
Edit
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
To monitor your app (e.g., Node Exporter):

yaml
Copy
Edit
  - job_name: 'node'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9100']
📊 Grafana Setup (Steps)
Login to Grafana (admin/admin).

Add Data Source → Select "Prometheus" → URL: http://localhost:9090.

Create Dashboard → Add Panel → Use PromQL like:
node_cpu_seconds_total, up, etc.

Save the dashboard.

🧠 COMMON PROMQL QUERIES
Task	Query Example
Check if instance is up	up
CPU usage rate	rate(node_cpu_seconds_total[5m])
Memory available	node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes
Disk space usage	node_filesystem_avail_bytes

🔔 Alerting Example (in prometheus.yml)
yaml
Copy
Edit
alerting:
  alertmanagers:
    - static_configs:
        - targets: ['localhost:9093']

rule_files:
  - "alert.rules.yml"
alert.rules.yml

yaml
Copy
Edit
groups:
- name: example
  rules:
  - alert: InstanceDown
    expr: up == 0
    for: 1m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "Instance is down"
🧪 BASIC INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
🟨 Theory Questions
What is Prometheus and how does it collect data?
Prometheus scrapes metrics from targets via HTTP. It pulls data periodically and stores it as time-series.

How does Prometheus differ from other tools like Nagios or Zabbix?
It uses pull model, is better suited for cloud-native infra, and has powerful querying.

What is PromQL? Give an example.
PromQL is a query language for Prometheus. Example: rate(http_requests_total[5m])

What is Grafana used for?
To visualize and analyze metrics from data sources like Prometheus.

What are exporters?
Exporters are agents that expose metrics in Prometheus format (e.g., node_exporter, blackbox_exporter).

What are Alert rules?
Rules defined in Prometheus to evaluate expressions and trigger alerts.

🟨 Practical / Coding / Command Based
Start Prometheus from CLI:

bash
Copy
Edit
./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml
Create a Grafana dashboard with a Prometheus data source.

Show a PromQL to monitor CPU usage.

promql
Copy
Edit
rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="user"}[5m])
How to reload Prometheus config without restart:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/-/reload
📈 PROFITABILITY (Career-wise)
High Demand: Prometheus + Grafana are core tools in DevOps/SRE toolchain.

Used by: Google, Netflix, Uber, etc.

Profitable Roles: DevOps Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer, Cloud Engineer.

Certifications: CNCF Prometheus Certified Associate (PCA) is upcoming.

📋 Template: Basic YAML for Prometheus
yaml
Copy
Edit
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'myapp'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8080']
✅ FINAL TIPS
Practice using PromQL.

Learn how to set up alerts and dashboards in Grafana.

Be able to explain why you monitor and what each metric means.

Know the difference between logs vs metrics vs traces.
